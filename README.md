## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Just Run the App.java file and you are good to go.
In case of any errors visit https://www.ipinfodb.com/register and generate a new API key
for free.
Just replace the existing API key with your own key in help.java file.
